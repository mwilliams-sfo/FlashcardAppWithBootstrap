This is a simple flashcard app that uses Bootstrap for styling, localForage
for data persistence, and otherwise is coded in plain JavaScript. The concept
and look of the app come from a video course by Mark Lassoff, but I built the
app after watching only his initial demo of how it should work and did not
follow along with the course.

jQuery is available in the app as part of Bootstrap, and it could make the code
much simpler, but Lassoff did not use it in his course and neither did I. While
I have deep respect for jQuery and its developers, improvements in browser
compatibility have reduced its usefulness.

Clicking on the card area rotates to the next card.
