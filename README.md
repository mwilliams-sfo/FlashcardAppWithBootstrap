This is a simple flashcard app that uses Bootstrap for styling, localForage
for data persistence, and otherwise is coded in plain JavaScript. The concept
and look of the app come from a video course by Mark Lassoff, but I built the
app after watching only the initial demo of how it should work.

jQuery is available in the app as part of Bootstrap, and using it would make
the code much simpler, but I did not use it because Lassoff said that he would
not.

Clicking on the card area rotates to the next card.
